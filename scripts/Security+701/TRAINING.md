## Section 1: General Security Concepts
**Topics:**
### 1.1 Security Controls
- Technical Controls (OS, System, Firewalls, Anti-virus)

- Managing Controls (Admin, Security Policies)

- Operational Controls (People instead of systems)

- Physical Controls (Guards, Locks, Badges)

<img width="1256" height="603" alt="1.1 Security Goals" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/1.1%20Security%20Goals.png?raw=true" />


### 1.2 Security Concepts
- The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
<img width="1256" height="603" alt="1.2 The CIA Triad" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/1.2%20The%20CIA%20Triad.png?raw=true" />

- Confidentiality: Encryption, Limits - access control, Two factor authenticaton

- Integrity: Hashing, Digital Signatures, Certificates, Non-reputation

- Availability: Redundancy (always up and running), Fault tolarance, Pathcing


### 1.3 Change Management
- Non-repudiation: Proof of integrity (encryption) + Proof of origin (authentication)

<img width="1256" height="603" alt="1.3 Authentication" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/1.2%20Authentication.png?raw=true" />

- Digital Signature:
<img width="1256" height="603" alt="1.3 Digital Signature" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/1.2%20Digital%20Signature.png?raw=true" />

- Verification of Digital Signature:
<img width="1256" height="603" alt="1.3 Verification of Digital Signature" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/1.4%20Verifying%20Digital%20Signature.png?raw=true" />

- Zero Trust:
<img width="1256" height="603" alt="1.3 Zero Trust" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/1.2%20Zero%20Trust%20.png?raw=true" />

### 1.4 Cryptographic Solutions

- Aunthentication - Authorization - Accounting

- Starts with identification -> Authorization is next -> A log of what happened shows the Accounting in terms of resources used. 

- Blockchain Ledger: Distributed Ledger keeps track of transactions, pay,ents, digital voting, etc.
<img width="1256" height="603" alt="1.4 Blockchain Process" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/1.4%20Blockchain%20Process.png?raw=true" />

- Digital Certifications: 

- Binds public key with a digital signature.

- PKI uses digital certificates to authorize for additional trust.
<img width="1256" height="603" alt="1.4 PKI" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/1.4%20Public%20Key.png?raw=true" />

- Standar format is X.509

- Details can be found on the certificate are Seriial #, Version, Signature algorithm, Issuer, Name, Public Key ...

- CRL - Revoked certificates go under clear list

- Example attack ==> "Heartbleed" Open SSL app library using app server private key - 2014

- OCSCP ==> Online Certificate Status Protocol (cross referencing CRL)

<img width="1256" height="603" alt="1.4 Encryption Algorithm Comparison" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/1.4%20Encryption%20Algorithm%20Comparison.png?raw=true" />

## Section 2: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations
**Topics:**
### 2.1 Threat Actors and Motivations
- ART ==> Advance Resistant Threat
- Example: "Stuxnet Worm"

### 2.3 Vulnerability Identification
- Memory Injections
- Buffer Overflows
- Race Condition
- Malicious Updates
- OS System Vulnerabilities
- SQL Injection
- Cross-site Scripting
- Virtualization Vulnerabilities
- Supply Chain Vulnerabilities
- Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities
- Mobile Device Vulnerabilities
- Zero-day Vulnerabilities
### 2.4 Indicators of Malicious Activity
- Malware
- Viruses and Worms
- Spyware and Bloatware
- Physical Attacks(ex: RFID cloning done by cloners sold on Amazon)
- Denial of Service attacks
  - Forcing a service to fail
  - DDoS: Distributed Denial of Service (launching an arm pf computers)
  - DDoS is an Asymetric Threat (number of attackers vs the number of services they reach)
  - DNS amplification DDoS
  <img width="1256" height="603" alt="1.4 DOS Amplification Distributed" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/1.4%20DDoS.png?raw=true" />
  - DNS Poisoning Attacks:
      - Modifies DNS server over the client host file that precedent over DNS queries.
      - Attack takes place by sending a fake response to a valis DNS request
      - Requirs a redirectioon of the original request
      - Occurs real time redirection
      - It's an on-path attack
      <img width="1256" height="603" alt="DNS Spoofing / Poisoning" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/2.4%20DNS%20Attacks%20-%20Spoofing%20and%20Posining.png?raw=true" />
- Wireless attack
    - Disconnects wireless users frequently by deauthentication causing a significant wireless DoS attack.
    - Main vulnerability associated with this attack relates to the 802.11 management frames that are sent and recieved by the access point to and from your machine.
    - Management frames are used to connect your device to the wireless network, manage connection, and disconnect from the network when we done with the wireless connection.
    - The connection and disconnection requires authentication and deauthentication of the device and the earlier versions of these management frames (802.11) didn't have the necessary security protocols (no encryption).
    - Packet capture on 802.11
    <img width="1256" height="603" alt="Packet capture on 802.11 wireless network" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/2.4%20Packet%20Capture%20on%20802.11.png?raw=true" />
    - IEEE has upgraded the management frames to 802.11ac by encrypting some of the important management frames (disassociate, deauthenticate, channel switch annoucements etc).
    - Sample Wireless Attack:
        - Getting the information from the network: Running a command with airodump-ng utility and specifying the wirelss connection:
        <img width="1256" height="603" alt="Wireless Attack airodump-ng utility" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/2.4%20Wireless%20Attack%20-%20airodump-ng%20to%20list%20the%20devices.png?raw=true" />
        - Listing hardware addresses for the wireless access point and the device:
        <img width="1256" height="603" alt="Wireless Attack listed the devicess" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/2.4%20Wireless%20Attack%20-%20airodump-ng%20returning%20device%20list.png?raw=true" />
        - Running a command to send deauthentication frames across the wireless network - using the utility "aireplay-ng" and specify "-0" to send deauthentication frames, select wireless access points (hardware ID) and the device we'd like to remove from the wireless with its mac address. 
        <img width="1256" height="603" alt="Wireless Attack sending aireplay-ng to deauth the device" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/2.4%20Wireless%20Attack%20-%20aireplay%20command%20to%20remove%20the%20device.png?raw=true" />
        - Once the aireplay runs the "pm" network listed on the left side would disappear and can't connect back as long as the command is running. 
        <img width="1256" height="603" alt="aireplay-ng disappears the network" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/2.4%20Wireless%20Attack%20-%20attacked%20network%20disappears%20.png?raw=true" />
        - As long as the deauthentication frames are sent the device can't connect to the wireless
        <img width="1256" height="603" alt="Wireless Attack device can't connect while the deauth frames are sent" src="https://github.com/burcuhuff/secure-agent-execution/blob/main/scripts/Security+701/2.4%20Wireless%20Attack%20-%20device%20can't%20connect%20while%20deauth%20frames%20are%20being%20sent.png?raw=true" />
